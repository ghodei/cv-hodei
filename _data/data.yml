    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hi! My name is Hodei and I completed a training program in electronics and worked six years successfully as a maintenance 
      technician at dbus (the public transport company of San Sebastian). My work included the installation and maintenance of 
      electric cables and the installation and repair of electronic assemblies. In addition, I have obtained knowledge in all 
      major operating systems (i.e. Windows, Mac OS and GNU / Linux).
      An essential part of my duties was to check and repair all the elements of the audiovisual system integrated into the buses 
      of the company. Other tasks were to perform preventive maintenance on the local server and fix any issues related to that.

      I have worked for two years in Germany as an IT support specialist. During this time, I have developed my skills to deal with
      customers and solve their problems as efficiently as possible. In my last company, I had, in addition to the normal activities
      of a helpdesk, the chance to test new technologies for improving the productivity of the department. One such project a new 
      inventory and ticket system and its deployment.
