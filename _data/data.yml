career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I worked six years successfully as a maintenance technician at dbus (the public transport company of San Sebastian, Spain). 
      My work included the installation and maintenance of electric cables and the installation and repair of electronic assemblies. 
      In addition, I have obtained knowledge in all major operating systems (i.e. Windows, Mac OS and GNU / Linux).

      I have worked for more than two years in Germany as an IT support specialist. During this time, I have developed my skills to
      deal with customers and solve their problems as efficiently as possible. In my last company, I had, in addition to the normal 
      activities of a helpdesk, the chance to test new technologies for improving the productivity of the department. One such project
      a new inventory and ticket system and its deployment.

      My last work experience was in Bogota, Colombia. There I was part of a support team that was in charge of assisting, remotely, 
      clients with problems that might arise, related to the company's proprietary software or hardware (credit card printers).
